Angular CLI application is used to execute DLL API query operations via PHP API services, which send HTTP requests to server
and get the responses. It will parse the events from the response data to generate the information displayed in the browser.

To run the program, I assume you have the following prerequisites.

Prerequisites

(1) Web server such as Wampserver installed on your development machine.
(2) PHP required by the back-end project installed on your system.
(3) Node.js 8.9+ and NPM installed in your system. This is only required by your Angular project.
(4) Angular CLI installed on your development machine. Angular CLI I am using is version 8.3.8.

Run the project

After building the project with ng serve command of Angular CLI, You can access the frontend application by your browser
using http://localhost:4200 address. The localhost:80 domain will be set for the RESTful PHP backend.
